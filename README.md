## Features  

### Web and Mobile Application  
- **Developed Using**: React (Web) and Progressive Web Application (PWA) technologies.  
- **Deployed**: Hosted on **Vercel** for web access and installable as a mobile app.  
- **PWA Integration**: Chrome install option for a seamless mobile experience.  

### Database and Authentication  
- **Database**: Supabase for real-time parking slot updates.  
- **Authentication**: Secure user login and management through Supabase.  

### Hardware Integration  
- **Working Model**: Built using Arduino and NodeMCU.  
- **Access Control**: RFID-based gate access system.  
- **Slot Detection**: IR sensors integrated with servo motors for automated control.  

### Communication  
- **Twilio API**: Sends booking confirmation messages to users for a secure and reliable experience.

## How It Works  

1. **User Login**: Users authenticate via the web or PWA app.  
2. **Slot Booking**: Users view real-time slot availability and book their preferred slot.  
3. **Confirmation**: Twilio API sends an SMS confirming the booking.  
4. **Gate Access**: RFID cards are used for entry; IR sensors and servo motors ensure automated access control.  
5. **Real-Time Updates**: The Supabase database keeps the app updated with the current parking status.
